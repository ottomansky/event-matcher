# Event Matcher - Improvements & Features

## üöÄ Major Enhancements

### 1. Auth0 for GenAI Integration

We've integrated Auth0's cutting-edge GenAI features to provide AI-powered event recommendations:

- **Token Vault**: Secure storage for OAuth tokens from multiple services
- **Fine-Grained Authorization (FGA)**: Document-level access control for RAG pipelines
- **Asynchronous Authorization (CIBA)**: Human-in-the-loop controls for sensitive actions
- **Multi-Service OAuth**: Connect Google Calendar, GitHub, and Slack

### 2. AI-Powered Recommendations

The new AI recommendation engine provides:

- **Calendar Availability Checking**: Automatically filters events based on your Google Calendar
- **Social Recommendations**: See which events your friends are attending
- **Personalization Scoring**: Learn from your swipe patterns to improve recommendations
- **Trending Events**: Discover popular events in your community
- **Privacy Controls**: Choose between strict, balanced, or open data sharing

### 3. Enhanced Luma Event Integration

- **Clickable Event URLs**: Events now have a "View on Luma" button that opens directly on lu.ma
- **URL Construction**: Automatically builds proper Luma URLs from the Apify data
- **Match Screen Links**: Click any matched event to view it on Luma

### 4. Performance Optimizations

- **Hardware Acceleration**: CSS transforms use GPU acceleration for smoother animations
- **Lazy Loading**: Images load on-demand to improve initial page load
- **Memory-Based Token Storage**: Enhanced security with in-memory token storage
